# Trivia for the Wicked 
## My game is built around my love for games. I used to play trivia games as a kid and always loved playing them. The categories and such are built around video game knowledge and other sorts of things.You have 3 guesses to win the game but if you do not get 3 you will lose.

# Next steps
## Add more design features such as a score tracker API that lists all of the users scores. I want to change the buttons to images as well as add sounds and more art to bring more of a relaxing feeling.
